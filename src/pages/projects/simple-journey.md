The Simple Journey is a unique thought of the day app focused around
simplicity, brevity and community. Starting in April 2020 as just an idea,
Heff Labs was responsible for the logo & branding, UI/UX design, mobile app
and corresponding backend, and played a key role through consulting to guide the direction
of the project.
