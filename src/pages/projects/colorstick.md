True Colors ColorStick is an app designed to replace printed color palettes at a local
hairstylist's business. The app is used by clients of the hairstylist to view colors to wear
that match their skin tone, eye color, etc, per the recommendation the hairstylist gives in
their color consulting service. Starting in June 2019, Heff Labs was responsible for the UI/UX
design, and mobile app.
